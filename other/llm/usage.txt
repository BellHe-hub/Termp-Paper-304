Can you write some R codes to testify this dataset?

ChatGPT
It seems there is still an issue with accessing the file. However, I can provide you with some general R code that you can use to analyze your dataset. Once the dataset is accessible, you can run this R code to perform common checks and analyses.

R Code to Test and Analyze Your Dataset:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load your dataset (replace 'cleaned_data.csv' with your actual file path)
data <- read.csv("path_to_your_cleaned_data.csv")

# 1. View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)

# 2. Check the structure of the dataset
str(data)

# 3. Summary statistics of the dataset
summary(data)

# 4. Check for missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(data))

# 5. Analyze distribution of stillbirth licenses
ggplot(data, aes(x = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Stillbirth Licenses", x = "Stillbirth Licenses", y = "Count")

# 6. Time series analysis (if time period is available as a Date)
# Assuming TIME_PERIOD is a Date or yearmon object
data <- data %>%
  mutate(TIME_PERIOD = as.Date(TIME_PERIOD, format="%Y-%m"))

# Plot stillbirth licenses over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Stillbirth Licenses Over Time", x = "Time", y = "Stillbirth Licenses")

# 7. Check for any trend over time
# Use simple linear regression to check for trend
model <- lm(STILLBIRTH_LICENSES ~ TIME_PERIOD, data = data)
summary(model)

# 8. Correlation analysis (if relevant variables are present)
# Check correlation between numeric variables
cor(data %>% select_if(is.numeric), use = "complete.obs")

# 9. Boxplot to examine distribution across different categories (if any categorical variables exist)
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(X_id), y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Stillbirth Licenses by X_id", x = "X_id", y = "Stillbirth Licenses")
Key Features of the Code:
Summary and Structure: The code will give you a quick overview of the dataset, including missing values and basic summary statistics.
Distribution Analysis: A histogram of the STILLBIRTH_LICENSES column will help visualize its distribution.
Time Series Analysis: If your dataset includes a time-related column, the code will plot stillbirth licenses over time and check for trends using linear regression.
Correlation and Categorical Analysis: If there are other numeric or categorical variables, the code will help identify relationships or group-wise differences.
This code should provide a comprehensive way to check the integrity and characteristics of the dataset once it's accessible. Let me know if you need further adjustments! ​​

No when I say test, I mean check for whether there are unreasonable stuff in it
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
I understand now! You want to validate the dataset to check for inconsistencies or potential issues such as unreasonable values, missing data, or incorrect data types. Here’s a more detailed R code that will help you check for common data issues and validate your dataset.

R Code for Data Validation:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load your dataset (replace 'cleaned_data.csv' with your actual file path)
data <- read.csv("path_to_your_cleaned_data.csv")

# 1. View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)

# 2. Check the structure of the dataset
str(data)

# 3. Check for missing values in each column
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(data))
print("Missing Values per Column:")
print(missing_values)

# 4. Check for negative or zero values in STILLBIRTH_LICENSES
# Stillbirth licenses should not be negative, and check if zero is acceptable in your context.
invalid_stillbirths <- data %>% filter(STILLBIRTH_LICENSES <= 0)
print("Rows with invalid stillbirth licenses (negative or zero):")
print(invalid_stillbirths)

# 5. Check if TIME_PERIOD is properly formatted and consistent
# Assuming TIME_PERIOD is in the format "YYYY-MM", we can check for parsing issues
data$TIME_PERIOD <- as.character(data$TIME_PERIOD)
invalid_time_periods <- data %>% filter(!grepl("^\\d{4}-\\d{2}$", TIME_PERIOD))
print("Rows with invalid TIME_PERIOD format (should be YYYY-MM):")
print(invalid_time_periods)

# 6. Check for unreasonable large values in STILLBIRTH_LICENSES (e.g., more than expected)
# You can define a threshold based on domain knowledge
unreasonable_stillbirths <- data %>% filter(STILLBIRTH_LICENSES > 100)  # Adjust the threshold as needed
print("Rows with unreasonably high stillbirth licenses:")
print(unreasonable_stillbirths)

# 7. Check for duplicate X_id values
duplicate_ids <- data %>% group_by(X_id) %>% filter(n() > 1)
print("Duplicate rows based on X_id:")
print(duplicate_ids)

# 8. Check for outliers in STILLBIRTH_LICENSES using the IQR method
Q1 <- quantile(data$STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(data$STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value

outliers <- data %>% filter(STILLBIRTH_LICENSES < lower_bound | STILLBIRTH_LICENSES > upper_bound)
print("Rows with outlier values for stillbirth licenses:")
print(outliers)

# 9. Summary of stillbirth licenses to check for reasonableness
print("Summary statistics for STILLBIRTH_LICENSES:")
summary(data$STILLBIRTH_LICENSES)

# 10. Ensure that TIME_PERIOD is unique and consecutive (if applicable)
# Checking for any gaps or duplicate periods
time_periods_unique <- data %>% select(TIME_PERIOD) %>% distinct()
time_periods_sorted <- sort(as.Date(paste0(time_periods_unique$TIME_PERIOD, "-01"), "%Y-%m-%d"))
print("Sorted distinct time periods to check for gaps:")
print(time_periods_sorted)

# Optional: Check specific conditions based on your dataset context
# For example, ensure that stillbirth licenses make sense for specific regions or periods
Key Tests Performed:
Missing Values: Identifies columns with missing values.
Negative or Zero Values: Flags rows where the number of stillbirth licenses is negative or zero.
Date Format Consistency: Ensures that the TIME_PERIOD column follows the YYYY-MM format.
Unreasonable Large Values: Filters out rows where stillbirth licenses exceed a reasonable threshold.
Duplicate IDs: Checks for duplicate X_id values.
Outlier Detection: Uses the interquartile range (IQR) method to detect outliers in stillbirth licenses.
Time Period Gaps: Verifies if the time periods are unique and sequential (if required).
How to Use:
Adjust the file path to load your dataset.
Modify thresholds (e.g., the maximum reasonable value for stillbirth licenses) based on your domain knowledge.
Run the checks and examine the output for potential data issues.
This code will help you ensure that the dataset is clean and free from unreasonable values. Let me know if you need further adjustments or have additional checks in mind!
